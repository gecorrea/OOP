//  OOP - Exercise 1
//  Implement a C struct called MyCPoint. Use it to represent a Point on a 2-D plane. What is the purpose of a struct?

#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct{
    int x, y;
} MyCPoint;

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    
    return 0;
}

// A struct is used to hold multiple sets of related data.
